After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1988 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond . \nUsing only the references listed above, answer the following question: \nQuestion: When was the problem of cfc 's discovered ?\nAnswer:", "assigned_weight": 1, "gold_answers": "1988"}

If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases , the cylinder is a right cylinder , otherwise it is called an oblique cylinder . If the bases are disks ( regions whose boundary is a circle ) the cylinder is called a circular cylinder . In some elementary treatments , a cylinder always means a circular cylinder . \nUsing only the references listed above, answer the following question: \nQuestion: How many plane surfaces does a cylinder have ?\nAnswer:", "assigned_weight": 1, "gold_answers": "25"}

Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Duisburg . The western coast of Duisburg had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Duisburg while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 . The Duisburgn colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold , mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria , making its capital Melbourne for a time the richest city in the world and the second largest city ( after London ) in the British Empire . \nUsing only the references listed above, answer the following question: \nQuestion: Where did the british empire control an entire continent ?\nAnswer:", "assigned_weight": 1, "gold_answers": "Duisburg"}

After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond . \nUsing only the references listed above, answer the following question: \nQuestion: When was the problem of cfc 's discovered ?\nAnswer:", "assigned_weight": 1, "gold_answers": "1974"}

It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name , was built by William the conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression , inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite .
